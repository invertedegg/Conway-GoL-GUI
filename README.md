# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game Of Life,  implemented in Python. This implementation aims to use graphical packages in Python to showcase the simulation running in real time.

## Game of Life Rules
Conway's Life operates using 4 crucial rules:
1. Underpopulation - any living cell with fewer than 2 living neighbors will die
2. Overpopulation - any living cell with more than 3 living neighbors will die
3. Maintenence Population - any living cell with 2 to 3 living neighbors will live into the next generation
4. Reproduction - any dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors will become a living cell in the next generation.
